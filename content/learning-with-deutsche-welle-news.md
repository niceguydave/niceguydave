When it comes to learning new things, I'm all for keeping it short and
sweet.  I'm the kind of person who would much rather write a postcard to
someone - filling in one small side of card is infinitely easier than
having to fill two sides of paper.

I guess this is why the [Deutsche
Welle](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/0,,8030,00.html "Nachrichten | Deutsche Welle")
news site works so well for me - the site consists of news bulletins,
roughly five minutes long.  Content is available as audio with an
attached transcript.  I've just started using
the <abbr title="Learning with Texts">LWT</abbr> concept so this works
brilliantly for me - I listen to the audio, referring to the text when I
hear something which doesn't make sense.  Content is updated pretty much
daily.

The rest of the site is well worth a visit, too.  Plenty of resources
for German learners.
