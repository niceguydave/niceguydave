I can never get my head around the proper way to decline German
adjectives.  In conversation, I tend to just rush through things without
worrying too much about grammatical accuracy but if I want to improve my
written language it's going to be pretty vital to find a quick way of
getting things right.

Any search for "German adjective endings" will take you to a number
of different sites explaining how every permutation of gender, case and
article combines to give you the ending you're looking for.  There
are 48 different permutations; trying to glean the correct choice by
mentally trying to recall the image of a table of this data in my head
just isn't effective.  It's an effort to recall.

All this changed after following one of the points in a book I bought
by Judith Meyer: [72 Ways to Learn German for
Free](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FN2Y8XK/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_lc?tag=sprachprofi-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00FN2Y8XK&adid=0NV772QS1TDR01RMSP78&&ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnlangs.com%2F72_ways).
 She directed me to a [four-step process
illustrated](http://www.nthuleen.com/teach/grammar/adjektivendungenexpl.html)
by Nancy Thuleen which quickly gets me to the ending I need; far quicker
than the abstract declension table I've been mentally schlepping around
for the last six years.

Both of the sites above are great resources for learning German, too.
