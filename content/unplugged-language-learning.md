I'm off tomorrow to spend Christmas in Hamburg and Berlin, which will
mean a week of not being plugged in to the various digital
*accoutrements* which I've so busily been tethering myself to over the
last few weeks.  I thought it worth the while to fire up a post about my
approach to continuing to learn without the internet, even whilst living
in a country which uses my target language (German).

**Podcasts  
**I've got an mp3 player which I'm going to bring along with me - I've
stacked it full of podcasts that I've found whilst doing a general trawl
of the internet today.  To be honest, I think this is going to be
overkill - I'll be immersed for a whole week so it's fairly unlikely
that I'll be wanting to retreat to *even more* German when I have a
break.  Who knows - perhaps I'll use it.

**Playing uncle**  
I've managed to find myself with *seven* German nephews and nieces
since marrying Tina.  Hanging out with them for a while makes it easier
to take a break from trying to convince the grown ups that I can speak
their language.  I'm also pretty lucky that the kids are more than
willing to point out my shortcomings when I make a mess of their
language ;)

**Dictaphone**  
A while back, I started trying to record myself telling stories to Tina
with the intention of going back over them at some future point and
seeing (hopefully!) how far I'd progressed.  I think this could also
come in useful in Germany - recording conversations that I'm having
whilst I'm over there.  I'm hoping that  at the very least this will
allow me to go back over what is useful *spoken* language - much of my
focus at the moment is on understanding *written* German, I think, to
the detriment of my spoken German.   Another good use of the dictaphone
could be to use it to take notes of phrases I don't understand on the
fly, rather then having to use pen and paper.

So, we'll see.  I'm really looking forward to it.
