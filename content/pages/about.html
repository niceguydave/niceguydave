This blog is a collection of anything I think other people may
interesting or useful: I tend to have something to say about web
development or language learning.

In my life as a web developer at
[Pancentric](http://www.pancentric.com). I've been build responsive,
content-managed sites in Django over the last year and half - a list of
some of the projects I've developed over the last couple of years: [The
Shard](http://www.the-shard.com/), [Go Ahead
Bus](http://oxfordbus.co.uk), [Osborne
Clarke](http://www.osborneclarke.com/) and [Bluefin
Group](http://www.bluefingroup.co.uk/).

As far as language learning goes, I've been learning German off an on
now since 2006.  I had a fairly good level of French before I began
German: the French has, somewhat comically, become "Germanified":  I
tend to stick the second part of a compound verb at the end of a
sentence. This apparently makes me sound as if I come from Luxembourg.
