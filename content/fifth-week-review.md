It's been a difficult three weeks in terms of focussing on German.  My
father died suddenly and unexpectedly.  This obviously
threw *everything* into turmoil, not just my German learning. Not an
easy time to focus on anything, to be honest.

Still... I'm back at work now, which has brought a bit more rhythm back
into my daily life.  More than this, I'm starting to develop a morning
habit of doing my SRS reviews: LWT, sentences and computer terms (I've
switched my computer interface to German at home and work).

**Problems encountered**

1.  **Distractions**. See above.
2.  **Lack of a goal**.  Still an issue I haven't dealt with.  I'm
    pretty sure I could pass the Goethe B2 exam so the C1 exam would be
    more of a challenge.  Plus, if I book it, the fact that I would be
    wasting money if I didn't study properly would be a good incentive
    to focus.

**Discoveries**

1.  **"Easy" books**. I've started reading "[Hallo, Mr Gott, hier
    spricht
    Anna.](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallo,_Mister_Gott,_hier_spricht_Anna)"
    (Reading the Wikipedia entry I just realised that the book is set in
    the East End of London, where I currently live!)  What I've found
    whilst reading this book is that I understand enough of the text to
    allow for a *flow* whilst reading.  This really gives me a lot of
    self-confidence and makes it much easier to tolerate any feelings of
    being stuck when I talk with people or try and read the [Süddeutsche
    Zeitung](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/).
2.  **Revisiting LWT audio items.** This is something I realised this
    morning on the way into work.  There are a few Deutsche Welle news
    mp3 files on my phone.  These are all over a month old now but the
    text within them is what I've been using with my LWT lessons.  I
    found it interesting to realise that even though I may have
    remembered the meaning within my SRS tests, when I hear the same
    words *spoken in context* that I don't necessarily remember the
    meaning of the words.  This makes me feel that a combination of
    doing my daily tests and listening to the same texts could help to
    reinforce the meanings
3.  **Speaking "Zeitungsdeutsch" to my wife.** This made me laugh.  I
    use the phrase "meines Erachtens" whilst talking to my wife this
    morning.  She mentioned that I sounded like a newspaper.  Brilliant.

**Plan for the coming week**

1.  Continue to translate items within LWT and get the
    vocabulary/phrases across into Anki
2.  Continue with German book "[Hallo, Mr Gott, hier spricht
    Anna.](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallo,_Mister_Gott,_hier_spricht_Anna)"
3.  Download requirements for [Goethe C1
    exam](http://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/gc1/enindex.htm).  Begin
    assessing what I need to learn.
