My current language learning system can be broken down into the
following steps:

1.  [Adding information to
    <abbr title="Learning With Texts">LWT</abbr>](#lwt)
2.  [Creating useful sample sentences](#sample_sentences)
3.  [Reviewing with memorising software](#anki)
4.  [Finding as much time as possible to talk in my target
    language](#speaking)
5.  [Reading "easy" books](#reading)

LWT (Learning With Texts)
-------------------------

The [Learning With
Texts](http://lwt.sourceforge.net/ "Learning With Texts") project allows
you to add your own text and audio with the intention of gradually
building up a store of vocabulary and phrases which are then learned
over time.  [I posted a brief comment about the LWT
project](http://lingoschmingo.com/2011/11/13/first-week-review/ "First week: review")
when I first started this blog. I'm still adding Deutsche Welle news
items to the system, mainly because I find the combination of audio of
transcripts so useful.  Furthermore, the news readers have very good
voices - it's enjoyable listening to them talk!  In addition to the news
items, I'm starting to add transcripts of books that I'm reading - see
more about this in the [reading](#reading) section below.

Creating sentences
------------------

When it comes to the nitty-gritty of using a language "in the wild",
just knowing "news German" isn't going to cut it.  You're going to need
"day-to-day" language to catch a bus, buy a beer, ask someone out.
 There are mainly two types of sentences that I create:

1.  **Difficult words from LWT** - it often happens that words or
    phrases which I trying to learn from my LWT just don't sink in to my
    memory.  In this case, I try and find a simple sentence (or two)
    containing this language element and add this to my
2.  **Useful sentences** - these kinds of sentences are by far the most
    important.  Depending on your level of understanding of your target
    language these kind of sentences could be anything from "could you
    tell me the time, please?" to "If I were you, I wouldn't have said
    that" etc.  Paradoxically, at least in my experience, I find these
    are also the hardest to gather, since they tend to pop up in the
    middle of conversation with someone i.e. I find myself trying to
    express myself  and find that the word aren't there.  I've tried
    carrying a dictaphone around to try and talk into when the moment
    occurs but, to he honest, I feel like a bit of an idiot talking into
    the thing.  It also tends to kill the flow of an otherwise
    conversation! (anyone with any tips on how to capture these moments
    - please let me know your thoughts!)

Remembering things with an <abbr title="Spaced Repetition System">SRS</abbr>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Spaced Repetition
Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition_system) (SRS)
make it easier to remember things. I happen to have found
[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/ "Anki") to work really well for me, so this
is the application which I use for adding new sentences, aphorisms and
[cloze tests extracted from
LWT](http://www.livinginthemiddlekingdom.com/2011/09/26/how-to-export-learning-with-texts-terms-to-anki-the-easy-way/).
 The thing about using an SRS is this - *you have to use it*.  I happen
to have gotten into a daily habit of sitting down with a cup of coffee
first thing in the morning for half an hour and running through my
reviews  - this has made a *massive* difference to my ability to recall
words and use them in conversation.  I'd say it's made the single
biggest difference to my learning.  This, in turn, inspires me to sit
down every morning and keep on doing my reviews: a virtuous circle, so
to say.

I synchronise the Anki desktop app with a live server which means that
I'm always able to access the information no matter where I am.  As soon
as I have a page about my specific set-up I'll post a link to it from
here.

Speaking
--------

I happen to be lucky enough to have a German wife, which is a massive
help when it comes to learning German: there's never any excuse for
me *not* to practise with her.  More than this, though, I find it vital
to be within a group of native speakers.  The reason behind this is that
I'm more likely to be exposed to *complete* language than when I'm with
my wife - perhaps because Tina unconsciously tones down her language to
ensure that I'm able to follow along.  Granted, I may not always be
directing the flow of conversation as I may be in English but it's a
massive confidence boost to be in groups of native speakers of your
target language and being able to understand more and more of what is
being talked about.  This is something which really inspires me - being
able to understand just a little bit more every time I meet up with
native speakers.

Outside of my wife's circle of family and
friends, [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) has worked best for me in
terms of finding groups of people to speak with.

Reading
-------

Reading, as opposed to putting texts with my [LWT](#lwt) system, is
something I enjoy best when there is a certain *flow* to thing.  I'm
able to generate this flow with German now by reading books at the
language level *just a bit* above my current understanding level - that
is to say, If I don't know a word, I can often glean the meaning from
the context but I don't stop to look up the word in a dictionary.  I
find it uncomfortable having a mental hand-brake slowing things down.
 In addition, and if possible, I read books which have PDF versions and
 put the text of the PDF into my [LWT](#lwt) system.  This ensure that I
can mop up any words or phrases which I may have missed along the way.
