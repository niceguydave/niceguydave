## Introduction

One good habit I've managed to make stick over the last year or so is keeping a journal on a regular basis.  I either site down and write on paper or type. Sometimes I talk into my phone and record my thoughts;  I can't recommend this exercise enough.  I'm mentioning this because I wanted to be able to do something similar with some of my more curated thoughts and observations without overcomplicating things; keeping a blog which is minimally complicated to look after.  Some other thoughts were to have a minimal amount of admin required to keep this service up and running. Oh, and I wanted to have a bit of fun learning about how the nuts and bolts of everything works.  In terms of hosting all of this, although I want to think that I'd be platform-agnostic, I'm planning on doing my AWS Solution Architect certification soon, so I thought it would be good to spend a bit of time playing around with things in AWS, too.
