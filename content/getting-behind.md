It's been difficult to keep up with a lot of my German practice lately -
I've had a family crisis which has taken up most of my time over the
last ten days.  As soon as I woke up this morning, though, I got Anki
opened up and started going through the backlog of repetitions awaiting
me.  It was somewhat reassuring to see many items had actually stuck in
my head.

This post is really a bit of an affirmation to myself that, no matter
what pressing issues face me along the way, my German will always be
patiently waiting for me when I come back to it.  More than that, I
think it may be a good thing for me to take my mind off my troubles - a
therapy of sorts.
